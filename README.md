Our project, Auto-Referee, is a webpage that helps its users understand the rules of the sport they are watching or want to play. Our page has three main parts: a header, a gallery, and the desciption area where one can learn about the different rules of a given sport. 

The header has the title and a brief description of the page. The gallery is an array of tiles that will display a sport's information or hide it when clicked on (this is done with a toggle function). Each section of sports' information has buttons on the left hand side named Goals, Basics, and Scoring, referring to each section of information for each sport. These buttons also toggle the sections in question, and so it will appear or disappear depending on it's toggle status.
